this sh file will create an alias for you in case you're dumb like me
and cannot remember the command `df -h` to save your LIFE

so basically chmod u+x this sh file on your server and run it, it'll add 
a record to your bashrc to have the alias `diskspace` on your command line
from now on.

stupid but effective. just like me
